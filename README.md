# Hotel-Recommendation-System
The hotel recommendation system aims to predict which hotel a user is most likely to choose from among all hotels. The dataset that I am using here is downloaded from Kaggle. As we are going to build a recommendation system according to the user ratings so here I will be using Natural Language Processing.
